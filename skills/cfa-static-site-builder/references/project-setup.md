# Project Setup And Configuration

Read this reference when starting a site, changing its editable collections,
setting brand or language data, or preparing deployment.

## Confirm Or Establish The Fork

A valid project root contains:

- `package.json` with `"name": "cfa-static"`
- `src/_data/site.json`
- `src/pages/`
- `BLOCKS_LAYOUT.md`
- `package-lock.json`

Use Node.js 22 or newer, npm, and a POSIX-compatible shell. Do not substitute
Bun, Yarn, or pnpm. Installing dependencies normally requires network access.

For a new site, the durable model is a GitHub fork of
`chobbledotcom/cfa-static`. Confirm the destination owner and repository name
before creating anything. If GitHub CLI is authenticated and the user approves,
`gh repo fork chobbledotcom/cfa-static --clone` is the default starting point.
Otherwise ask the user to create and clone the fork. Do not silently create a
plain upstream clone as the site's long-term repository.

After cloning:

```bash
npm install
```

Keep the template repository as an `upstream` remote only if the site owner
wants to pull reviewed template updates later.

## Capture The Site Decisions

Before replacing content, establish:

| Decision | Destination |
|---|---|
| Name, canonical URL, description, socials | `src/_data/site.json` |
| Navigation/search/theme behavior | `src/_data/config.json` |
| News/guide labels and permalink segments | `src/_data/strings.json` |
| Chrome labels such as home, breadcrumbs, and skip links | `src/_data/languages.json` |
| Organization/schema metadata | `src/_data/meta.json` |
| Published languages and chrome labels | `src/_data/languages.json` |
| Equivalent pages across languages | `src/_data/translations.json` |
| Site-wide block columns | `src/_data/blockLayouts.json` |
| Colors, fonts, spacing, radii | `src/css/theme.scss` |

Use exact user-supplied values. `site.json` requires a real `name`, `url`, and
`description`. The URL must be an HTTP(S) base URL without trailing slash,
query, fragment, surrounding whitespace, or an example hostname.

Organization metadata is optional. Omit facts that are not known instead of
inventing founders, addresses, phone numbers, or dates.

Inspect `src/_data/strings-base.json` before adding a string override; arbitrary
keys do not make templates consume a new label.

## Choose Collections And CMS Features

The CMS customizer controls what editors see; it also regenerates `.pages.yml`
and the matching TypeScript declarations. Inspect the live choices rather than
copying a stale list:

```bash
npm run customise-cms -- --list-collections
npm run customise-cms -- --list-features
```

Useful non-interactive patterns:

```bash
# Preview a simple pages + news setup
npm run customise-cms -- --collections news --dry-run

# Enable news and guides with page-level FAQs and galleries
npm run customise-cms -- --collections news,guide-categories,guide-pages --enable faqs,galleries --quiet

# Enable everything except the visual editor
npm run customise-cms -- --all --disable use_visual_editor --quiet

# Rebuild artifacts from the saved cms_config
npm run customise-cms -- --regenerate --quiet
```

`pages` and `snippets` are always included. Selecting `guide-pages` also pulls
in `guide-categories`. Use a dry run when the requested editing surface is
ambiguous, inspect the output, then run the writing command. The writing path
saves `cms_config` in `site.json` and regenerates both CMS artifacts.

Do not enable collections merely because they exist. A brochure site may need
only pages. Enable news only for dated publishing and feeds; enable guides only
for categorized documentation. These choices change PagesCMS, not Eleventy
publication. To remove news or guides from a site, also remove their demo
content, listing pages, navigation entries, and related links such as RSS where
the brief does not require them. Confirm the resulting routes after building.

## Navigation And Information Architecture

Page navigation is declared in frontmatter:

```yaml
eleventyNavigation:
  key: About
  order: 2
```

Use short, unique labels and deliberate ordering. Avoid putting utility pages
such as search, accessibility statements, or privacy details in primary
navigation unless the brief calls for them.

Internal links should be site-relative (`/about/`), never hardcoded deployment
origins. The build rewrites them for `PATH_PREFIX` deployments.

## Theme And Brand

Start with `src/css/theme.scss`. The repository also includes prebuilt
`src/css/theme-*.scss` files and a live `/theme-editor/` that exports a complete
theme file.

For a new visual direction:

1. derive color, type, density, and image treatment from the brief
2. choose the closest existing theme or use the theme editor
3. replace `theme.scss` with the exported tokens
4. add component CSS only for requirements tokens cannot express
5. check desktop and mobile output, focus states, contrast, and long text

Do not mix multiple prebuilt themes or add arbitrary one-off values throughout
block styles. Preserve the token system.

## Languages

Each entry in `languages.json` must provide every chrome label required by the
current schema. Copy the shape of the existing default-language entry, then use
real translated labels. Set one and only one default language.

Place translated pages under their language URL prefix and pair equivalent
routes in `translations.json`. Read nearby multilingual tests and content before
editing. Language declarations are validated, but malformed translation groups
can silently omit or misdirect hreflang links, so inspect every language pair in
the built output.

Do not machine-translate publishable copy unless the user explicitly accepts
that workflow and arranges human review.

## Deployment

The bundled GitHub Pages workflow supports project sites and custom domains.
The user must enable **Settings > Pages > Source: GitHub Actions** once. The
workflow currently uses Ubicloud runners, which are not automatically available
to a new fork. Before deployment, ask the owner either to configure the Ubicloud
GitHub integration and billing or to approve changing both workflow jobs to an
available runner such as `ubuntu-latest`.

The workflow provides:

- `PATH_PREFIX` for project-site subpaths
- `SITE_URL` for canonical URLs, sitemap entries, feeds, and schema metadata

For another static host, publish the generated `_site/` directory. There is no
application server and no build-time secret requirement.

Do not change runners, permissions, domains, or repository settings without a
specific request. Report an unconfigured runner as a deployment prerequisite,
not as a successful setup.
